This folder contains the sources for the flare-documentation that is published to readthedocs.org.

## Locally generating docs

To locally generate the docs, once run

```
pip install sphinx sphinx-autoapi
```

after that, run e.g. `make html` for the HTML-target from this folder.

The compiled version of the docs can be found in docs/build/html afterwards.
